Prequisites:

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-classify-pgie-test/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
    GStreamer-1.0
    GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
    GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
    X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

Compilation Steps:
  clone code to the path /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/apps/sample_apps
  
  $ Set CUDA_VER in the MakeFile as per platform.
      For Jetson, CUDA_VER=10.2
      For x86, CUDA_VER=11.4
  $ sudo make

To run:
  $ ./deepstream-classify-pgie-test <Raw video stream (example: YUV)> <width of stream>
      <height of stream> <expected FPS of stream> <format of stream (example: I420, NV12, RGBA)>

  sample: ./deepstream-classify-pgie-test redcar-720p-I420.yuv 1280 720 1 I420
